SHELLSHOCK - WEB

In this attack, we used the vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271), however, we implemented it on a web server running on a docker container to deface that web page.

at first I run apache2 service

--> systemctl start apache2.service


Then I run docker container on port 8080

docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 vulnerabilities/cve-2014-6271


Now, the attacker will run the following script to exploit the vulnerability

./exploit-deface.sh   #victim-ip-address  8080

and now, if we enter victim ip address in our browser the web page is defaced.
