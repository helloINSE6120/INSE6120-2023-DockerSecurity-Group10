I used Trivy Defense tool to scan vulnerabilities and security problems on docker container images and their dependencies.
For testing that, at first I ran DVWA container. This is pre-vulnerable container for testing.

--> docker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa

So now the vulnerable container is running.
Then I pull trivy container

--> docker pull aquasec/trivy

at last we pass the web-dvwa container to trivy to scan that and find vulnerabilities.

--> trivy image vulnerability/web-dvwa

after that, trivy shows all the known vulnerabilities that it has on its database.
